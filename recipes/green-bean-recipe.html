                <br>
                <p>In college, my relationship with vegetables was one of indifference. They seemed like obligatory sidekicks to the main dish. However, everything changed when I moved into my first apartment and realized that if I wanted to eat healthier, I had to learn to cook.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Vegetables, once relegated to a bland existence in my meals, became my canvas for culinary exploration. I started with something simple: green beans. As a beginner in the kitchen, roasting seemed like a safe bet.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With a bunch of fresh green beans, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of garlic and Parmesan, I embarked on my veggie journey. As they roasted in the oven, the kitchen filled with a tantalizing aroma—the sizzle of oil, the earthiness of garlic, and the promise of something delicious.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I finally pulled out the roasted green beans, they were a revelation. Tender yet crispy, each bite burst with flavor. It was a eureka moment—the realization that with a little love and attention, vegetables could be not just palatable but downright irresistible.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From that day forward, vegetables became my partners in culinary crime. They were no longer a boring necessity but the stars of my meals. And those roasted garlic Parmesan green beans? They were the catalyst for a newfound love affair with vegetables, proving that sometimes, all it takes is a little roasting to unlock a world of flavors.</p>
